Description: Parallel computing, multi-core CPU is used to efficiently compute
    and process multi-dimensional soil data.This package includes the 
    parallelized Quantile Regression Forests algorithm for Digital Soil Mapping 
    and is mainly dependent on the package 'quantregForest' and 'snowfall'.
    Detailed references to the R package and the web site are described in the
    methods, as detailed in the method documentation.
