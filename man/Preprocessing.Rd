\title{As a data preprocessing function, sets some global variables that are not visible to the user}
\usage{
Preprocessing(Fpath, FEncoding, nblock, ncore, foldername, sample.name)
}
\arguments{
\item{Fpath}{: the path of file}

\item{FEncoding}{: the encoding of file}

\item{nblock}{: the number of blocks for data cutting}

\item{ncore}{: Computes the CPU's kernel in parallel(fill in according to the computer configuration)}

\item{foldername}{: Name of the folder in which the soil data is stored}

\item{sample.name}{: Standard soil files, which can be used as sample files (under in the FolderName)}
}
